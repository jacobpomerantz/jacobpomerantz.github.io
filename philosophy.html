                        Definitionally, the word <i>philosophy</i> comes from the greek words <i>philo</i>, meaning love, and <i>sophia</i>, meaning wisdom.

                        Historically, philosophy is the study of epistemology, metaphysics and ethics. If you, like most, only know what ethics are, then let me fill you in on the other two.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Epistemology:</strong> The theory of knowledge (according to Dr.Google). In my words, it is asking the questions, "what do we know?" and "how do we know it?" Epistemologists are concerned with understanding what <u>knowledge</u> actually is (seems overcomplicated right?)
                        and how we acquire it (empirically vs. theoretically). It is the basis of separating justified fact from opinion.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Metaphysics:</strong> The branch of philosophy concerned with our <i>present</i> and <i>future</i> states of being. 
                        Metaphysics asks the questions like "is the world composed of atoms?," "How did it come to be?," and "Does heaven exist? What about G-d?"   <!-- Do I want to write more? -->
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Personally, philosophy is synonymous with perspective. Philosophy is the deep thoughts you ask yourself when your Dad dies. It is the questions you ask yourself when you are experiencing a mid-life crisis: <!-- is this proper grammar -->trying to figure out who you are and what you want from life. 
                        <br>

                    <p>
                      There are two main sources of philosophy which both have very different approaches to life: to be honest, I'm not sure which one I subscribe to. 
                      Western philosophy refers to ideas that originate from the western world (obviously). However, for the sake of my philosophical argument, I am referring to a train of thought that originated during the classical period in Ancient Greece (5th and 4th centuries BC). 
                      Eastern philosophy consists of philosophies developed in East and South Asia. Eastern philosophy largely encapsulates the philosophical underpinnings of many of the prominent eastern religions including Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism.
                      My philosophy is that there is one defining idea that separates these two sources of thought, and it has been influential in trying to understand my <i>purpose</i>.

                       While the title of this post may seem like I'm about to embark on some complex philosophical dialogue, I promise that is not the case.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       In my opinion, there are three levels to understanding.    <!-- write more? Add to previous line? -->
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <i><b>Level 1: <!-- bold and/or italicize? --></b></i>Have you ever been in class or on the job learning something for the first time feeling like everything is barely scraping the surface of your mind. I can tell you I definitely have and man do I feel stupid. 
                       I have needed concepts or instructions explained to me 3 maybe 4 times before I felt competent enough to even try it on my own. However, that feeling when you realize while helping or explaining something to someone else that you ARE knowledgeable is the best is the world.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <i><b>Level 2: <!-- bold and/or italicize? --></b></i>You understand something! You feel like a king. You are able to engage in conversation with others and share something of your own. However, this feeling is short lived because with the knowledge you've gained, you also come to realize how little you actually know. <!--You were once a king, but then you understood that a king is a nobody among a crowd of kings. In my case, I was once at the top of my class. Then I went to college and swiftly dropped to the bottom. -->
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <!-- fun fact? How do I want to start this sentence -->Here's a fun fact. Socrates, the father of western philosophy, never actually wrote any philosophy. In fact, most of our understanding of his ideas comes from works written by his pupil Plato in which Socrates stars as the main character. In one of his dialogues, "Apology," Socrates ventured out to find a man smarter than himself. 
                       Upon having conversations with others, who claimed to be experts in their fields, and asking the question "why?" Socrates understood that they knew nothing and became aware of his own ignorance. 
                       <br>
                       <br> <!-- one or two line breaks -->
                       <i>"For I was conscious that I knew practically nothing..."</i>
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Understanding anything comes at the steep price of understanding that you really know nothing - about that subject or anything else. Yet, there is a significance in beginning on the road of obtaining knowledge. Knowledge makes life interesting: it makes life beautiful to look at. To look through a different lens and understand another perspective. 
                       <br>
                       <br> <!-- one or two line breaks -->
                       <i>"An unexamined life is not worth living."</i>
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       <i><b>Level 3: <!-- bold and/or italicize? --></b></i>Now I know there is a little bit of a disconnect between my second and third levels. My second level <b>almost</b> argues that it is impossible to become truly knowledgeable, at least in relation to others or knowledge that exists. 
                       My third level of understanding describes one as knowledgeable when knowledge becomes intuition: automatic. It's when talking about something becomes natural, like drinking water. I'm sure we have all experienced it at least once in our lives when you think, "Damn! I'm spitting."

                      Below is a piece of writing from when I began my philosophical <!-- philosophy? -->journey years ago. My interest arose out of need to cope with realities I had never experienced before. There is something to be said about people "finding G-d" when they need it most. It is a little disorganized, but at it's core, it speaks to my perspective on life.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      It’s 12:30 and all I can think right now, in addition to the things I want to focus my time on: meditation, reading - book and current events, working out, and philosophy - is why are we here. My existence on this planet makes no sense. In a way, the cognitive recognition of humans is a curse. We are an animal species that is here trying to make their mark on the world before we are extinct, and yet, our mark is “marked” by death, and the destruction of our planet. I’m here in my bed trying to find a reason that can help me figure out what to do with my life. I’m not going to spend my life doing something pointless, so what do I do. I mean can or should I be content with not knowing?
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      A tornado just killed 90 people in Kentucky. Many civilians just died due to the CIA trying to destroy ISIS strongholds. People are randomly stabbing each other everyday on the streets of the Old City; these are just 3 of an endless string of depressing happenings worldwide. Not to mention, if you are lucky enough to survive the catastrophes of the world and people within, you have to be lucky enough to have good health and consistently survive the countless internal (heart disease) and external (car accidents) predators. And at the end of all of this, we die anyways one day: we fight, we fight, we fight to stay alive, then we die at the end of the day anyways. So where does one find happiness and meaning in life. I think love? 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      As I heard this summer, “If you live for yourself you die in vain. If you live for others you live again.” But honestly I’m not sure. I don’t think most people have taken the time to understand what I just did. I don’t know whether I was lucky or cursed to have but if leaves me with many questions and much to figure out.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Carl Sagan once wrote, "We are a way for the universe to understand itself.” This makes sense to me, but if we don't understand our place within this universe and neither do the simple, unknowing animals that roam the earth - everything exists just to and that’s all. There is no meaning really. So where does that leave me?
